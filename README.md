# motorcycle-safety-quiz
motorcycle safety themed quiz created with html, css, js, and jquery.

How I got to current product:
I first gathered 10 questions and its respective answer that will be used in the quiz and a few images. I then went on to create a basic template by hardcoding elements and commenting areas in the html document. When I felt that there is some good structure, I refactored the html document where there will be specific sectioning elements so that I can simply modify using javascript and jQuery. Once html document has been minimized, I created comments listing possible functions that might be used to create the different behaviors. One by one I created the functions needed. lastly went to css to style the page to look neat and clean using the many different properties and with media queries I was able to create a sense of responsive design.

Technical:

-Start screen that shows an Icon and a button to begin the quiz.
-Scoring section to show how current score.
-Quiz form that shows current question and 4 different answers to choose from, followed by a button to submit form and navigate to the feedback section.
-The feedback section shows whether user chose correct answer and displays the actual answer, followed by a button to navigate to the next question or if the 10th question has been answered we go to the final review section.
The final review section just shows text based on how many questions answered correctly, an image, and a button to go back to start screen.
